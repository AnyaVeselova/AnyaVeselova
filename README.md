## Hi there 👋

Linguist by training and a language tutor, I embraced a new challenge by transitioning to software development. I discovered that the structure and grammar of language were what I loved most about teaching. Coding became my bridge, merging my passion for learning with my fascination for language’s logic. After completing the Scrimba Front-End Career Path and Northcoders full-stack bootcamp, I now contribute to the open-source project Kindly and continue expanding my skills with Founders and Coders, focusing on the latest technologies in a team of 11 talented individuals. Open to relocation, I’m eager to join a team where I can build, grow, and solve meaningful problems.
